# Assignment 1: Image Classification
Build a classification model for Kaggle's Dogs vs Cats dataset. Your goal is to identify the animal presents in the image.
## 1. Dataset
The dataset [link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats) from Kaggle site.
Donwload the zip file clicking by the "Download All" button in the [data panel](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dogs-vs-cats/data).
## 2. Submission
1. Create a new branch on this repository with the syntax of [name]-[student_id] (i.e. vuong_viet_hung-20192210).
2. Upload your project, excluded the data, to the respected branch.
3. Finish the project prior to Friday, 21st October.
## 3. Requirements
1. Code written as a plain Python project or in IPython Notebook (Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook).
2. Acceptable accuracy (>75%) achieved by the model.
3. Being a able to explain the model architecture, loss function, optimization algorithm and performance metrics.
4. Clean code, thorough documentation and well-structured project.
## 4. Model suggestion
1. Sequential models - Simple model with the output of the preceding layer becomes the input of the following: VGGNet, AlexNet, Le-Net, ...
2. Other models: ResNet, MobileNet, EfficientNet, ...
